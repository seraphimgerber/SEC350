### Lab 1 - SEC-350 - VYOS Entry

#### Here is the assignment:

Create a standalone article on VyOS. Make sure you document those commands used during this course of this lab like setting the hostname, interfaces, gateway, dns, nat and dns forwarding. 

#### So, in my Lab 1.1, I covered how to set up our firewall box Fw01, which is a vyos router/firewall that connects the SEC-350 (ISP), DMZ, and LAN networks. But first, what is VyOS?

VyOS is an open source network operating system Linux distribution based on Debian.
VyOS provides a free routing platform that competes directly with other commercially available solutions from well-known network providers. Because VyOS is run on standard amd64 systems, it can be used as a router and firewall platform for cloud deployments. VyOS can also be optimized to achieve routing at 100Gbps.
Besides being open-source, VyOS also offers subscription-based support, which includes pre-built images for cloud and virtual environments and LTS images for the 1.3 and 1.4 series.

#### So it's pretty much an open-source operating system that has some cool features like routing, firewalls, and VPNs. Thanks, Wikipedia. 

#### Now, if you want to see the commands that I used, you can check it out in my [Lab1.1](https://github.com/seraphimgerber/SEC350/blob/main/Lab1.1.md#now-lets-set-up-fw01-heres-a-checklist-to-follow).
